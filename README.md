Very quick, This is a repository on my journey to learn how to code, starting with Python. This is my second time using Git and GitHub and as such I've made a bunch of mistakes.

The code is for a very simple website which has a login and register functionality paired with hashing and salting for passwords.

There is a huge vulnerability in the code which is that the comments made by people that register in the website has the "|safe" Because CKEditor was dysplaying the used tags for some reason, I also just searched up a quick solution.
This is bad as this basically makes it so that certain tags are ignored leaving the cite vulnerable to certain attacks. 
Also the CKEditor verion used in this project is outdated and is open to other vulnerabilities.

But then again this was just a learning activity and as such will not be changed. However if you are going to use this, first. Why? and second you should be aware of it.
